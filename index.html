            Our Journey

        <p class="jour-2">
            We use sustainable energy when possible but due to our line of work, that isn't always easy. However, we are dedicated to minimising our enviromental impact so we donate 10% of our profits to funding research to make and improve sustainable transportation.
        </p>
        <p class="jour-3">
            Another 10% of our profits goes to aquatic wildlife protection societies aswell as organisations that specialise in cleaning up our oceans. We are so devoted to protecting the earth here at Freightwide, we set aside time to volunteer at local wildlife sanctuaries and clean up committees.
